This paper presents a thorough introduction to the state of the art
of Neurographs and Brain networks explaining the basic concepts and
highlighting the most important features and techniques available today.
I highlight the most used metrics and Global and Local properties of
graphs. Then I explain two types of connectivity: effective and functional
and list the most important techniques for each of them. Furthermore I
point out a great new technique developed this year that may yield great
results. I conclude wrapping up the exposed elements and talk about fu-
ture challenges.
